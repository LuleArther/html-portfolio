<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Lule Arther, a passionate environmentalist and a second-year BeVisioneers fellow. I'm deeply committed to creating sustainable solutions for my community through impactful initiatives like tree planting, waste management, and clean water projects.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm pursuing a BSc in Software Engineering at Victoria University in Uganda. My journey in tech involves exploring creative solutions to pressing challenges, including my work on the 'Plastics to Life' project, which aims to tackle plastic pollution by converting HDPE waste into durable, eco-friendly building materials.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding or organizing community events, you'll find me brainstorming innovative ideas for the LEAH Initiative, where I serve as the Programs Coordinator. Through this role, I've led exciting projects like school outreach programs, community clean-ups, and tree-planting activities that inspire others to take action against climate change.</p>

<p>In addition to my environmental and tech endeavors, I enjoy taking courses on platforms like Udemy to expand my skills, particularly in web development and coding. I'm also fascinated by research, currently exploring why many IT students graduate with limited coding skillsâ€”because I believe in empowering my peers to excel.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I love collaborating with young environmentalists and sharing my journey to motivate others. Whether it's through technology, sustainability, or education, I'm always on a mission to leave the world a little better than I found it.</p>
